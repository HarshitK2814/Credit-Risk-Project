## ⚖️4. Key Architectural Decisions & Trade-offs

This project's final architecture is the result of solving several complex, real-world challenges.

#### 🔹1. The Challenge: A Flawed, Biased Model
*   **Problem:** Our initial models exhibited a strong "mean-reversion bias," giving dangerously high scores (90+) to volatile stocks like `SMCI` that had recently crashed, ignoring obvious fundamental risks.
*   **Decision:** We abandoned the single-model approach and re-architected to a **"Fundamentals First" two-part system.** A stable, rule-based `fundamental_score` (based on debt, profitability, etc.) acts as an anchor. A specialized `technical_model` then calculates a `technical_penalty` based on market risk. The final score is `fundamental_score - technical_penalty`.
*   **Outcome:** This completely eliminated the bias. A company with poor fundamentals can now **never** achieve a high score, regardless of its market behavior. This makes the final score far more robust and trustworthy.

#### 🔹2. The Challenge: Real-Time Updates vs. UI Latency
*   **Problem:** Retraining a model on every request would provide maximum data freshness but would cause an unacceptable 15-30 second delay in the UI.
*   **Decision:** We implemented a **hybrid training architecture** using FastAPI's `BackgroundTasks`. The user receives an instant score based on the latest data applied to a pre-trained model. In the background, an asynchronous task is triggered to retrain the model with that new data.
*   **Outcome:** The UI is instantaneous, while the model's intelligence is continuously updated, providing the best of both worlds.


## 📊5. Model Performance & Explainability

Accuracy is only half the story. The core challenge of the hackathon was to replace the "black box" with a transparent, evidence-backed system that analysts can trust. Our platform is built from the ground up to achieve this.

### Model Accuracy & Robust Validation

Our model's goal is to predict periods of **future instability**, which we define as a combination of negative returns and high volatility. To ensure our model is genuinely predictive and not simply lucky, we employ a robust validation strategy:

1.  **Holdout Test Set:** For each ticker, the historical data is split. 80% is used for training, and the final 20% is held back as a completely unseen test set to measure true performance.
2.  **Intelligent Tuning:** We use **Optuna** for efficient hyperparameter optimization, allowing us to find the best-performing model configuration for each stock's unique historical patterns.
3.  **Realistic Metrics:** The model's performance is measured by the **AUC (Area Under the Curve)** score on the holdout test set. This metric tells us how well the model can distinguish between stable and unstable future periods.
    *   For a stable, well-documented stock like **NVDA**, our model achieved a **Final Test Set AUC Score of ~0.9619**, demonstrating high predictive accuracy.
    *   For a more volatile and fundamentally complex stock like **SMCI**, the model achieved a more realistic but still powerful **AUC Score of ~0.9653**. This score confirms the model has genuine predictive power without the artificially high results often caused by model bias.

### The Power of Explainability (Our Core Innovation)

A score is meaningless without context. Our platform's greatest strength is its ability to make the AI's reasoning transparent. We use **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)**, the industry-standard for XAI, to generate the "Why this score?" chart.

This feature was not just a design choice; it was our **most critical debugging tool**. Initially, our models produced illogical high scores for risky stocks. By analyzing the SHAP charts, we diagnosed a critical "mean-reversion bias" and re-architected our system to be **"Fundamentals First."**

The result is a model that now correctly balances competing factors, as seen in the analysis for **Super Micro Computer (SMCI)**:

As the chart above proves, our platform doesn't hide complexity—it reveals it:

*   **The Anchor of Risk (Red Bar):** The model correctly identifies that the company's **`Debt-to-Equity`** ratio is the single largest factor *increasing* its risk profile. This is our fundamental handbrake in action.
*   **The Market's Opinion (Green Bars):** The model also shows that technical factors like `volatility_90d` and `rsi_14d` are currently seen as *decreasing* the risk, likely due to an "oversold" condition.

An analyst can now instantly understand the nuanced story: the company has fundamental weaknesses, but its recent market behavior suggests short-term stability. This transforms the model from a black box into a sophisticated tool for thought, perfectly fulfilling the core challenge of the hackathon.

## 🏆 Why CredLens Stands Out  

✨ **Transparent & Explainable → From "Black Box" to Glass Box**  
We don't just provide a score; we provide the reasoning. Using **SHAP** and a clear UI, analysts can instantly see the specific drivers — from market volatility to fundamental debt — that influenced the final number. This builds trust and transforms the platform from a simple predictor into a true intelligence tool.  

✨ **Robust & Reliable → A "Fundamentals First" Architecture**  
Our biggest innovation is our **two-part scoring system**. A stable, rule-based **Fundamental Score** acts as a powerful anchor, preventing the model from being fooled by irrational market hype or biased technical signals. This guarantees that a company with poor financial health can never receive a misleadingly high score — solving a critical flaw found in simpler models.  

✨ **Real-Time Insights, Zero Latency → A Hybrid Training Model**  
Our platform is built for the **now**. It provides **instantaneous scores** based on the latest available data, but intelligently queues up a **full model retraining in the background** using FastAPI's asynchronous tasks. This gives the user a **real-time experience without lag**, while ensuring the system's intelligence is constantly refreshed.  

✨ **Production-Ready & Resilient → Built for the Real World**  
The entire backend is **containerized with Docker** for reproducibility and deployed securely using environment variables. The system is resilient to failure, automatically falling back to a **heuristic assessment** if an ML model cannot be trained — ensuring the user always gets a useful insight.
